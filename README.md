# dnkg-pilot
Dutch National Knowledge Graph (DNKG) Pilot

A repo to capture the necessary information to build the DNKG via DBpedia cartridges. We use Github prototyping to capture information in files and version them. Once we feel confident that information is complete and things run smooth, we will implement a user interface and better tools.  The structure is very similar to the Databus folder structure.

## Schema Mapping Prototype
xplain how refresh works 

## Cartridge Spreadsheetlink

A spreadsheet is used to show the general properties information for each dataset and the corresponding mapping results. The spreadsheet information is refresh each time it is opened, retrieving it from web services and endpoints. The spreadsheet contains a list of properties and their corresponding direct mappings, if exists, a summary of the prefixes and a brief mapping statistics.

## Folder structure

`cartridges/user/source/partition`

where 
  * `user` is the person or organisation producing the data
  * `source` is a short name for the general source of the dataset within that organisation
  * `partition` is a name for the partition generated by `export.construct`. Often a class or category, but arbitrary partitions can be selected in the where clause.
  
## Files 
  * `metadata.ttl` specifies where to acquire the data in a single triple. Note that later the Databus will keep much better metadata and provenance. 
     ```
     @prefix dev: <http://example.com/dev#>.
     <> dev:databusversion <https://databus.dbpedia.org/jj-author/kadaster/bag/2020.07.29> . 
     ```
  * `export.construct` executed over the data to create a partition to be indexed: see [2.4.4. Specify ID space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19VbocJaTaXDlTtOaO8DgbMDgRQo0OhYwvQ3M7CuRDvs/edit#heading=h.uq0c3d5vz3j8) or look at the examples
  * `links.construct` executed over the data to construct the links 
  * `$dbo-property.pt-construct` 0...n files that export the complex structure described in the where clause, to a flat, coarse-grained DBpedia-like structure in the CONSTRUCT clause
